# ZERO Engine: Player Moverment Scripts
A set of scripts for player movement in the game space for the Unity-based ZERO Engine.

If you want the player to collide with objects that are not on the default layer, you can set the layer mask in the SurfPhysics class.

You can use the included 'Example player prefab' as a base, or just add SurfCharacter to an empty object and do the looking/aiming system yourself.
